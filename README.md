# task11-individual
i found a similar code on geeksforgeeks
so i basically understod the code then copy and pastes
the problem that i faced is that the code didnt detect the rest of the shapes with deifferent colours than the web
and also had to resize the image because imag res was bigger than the screen res
i applied masking with all the available shape colours with its ranges i found online
but before i did that i had to convert image from bgr to hsv
